# Vulnerability Capstone THM

This is by far the easieset "Capture the Flag" challenge there is on tryhackme. I did this room as part of the vulnerability research module, I highly recommend the module 
to anyone learning vulnerability exploitation as it gives you a good background to start effecively using exploits.

The first question asked the name of the application running on the machine. I skipped the nmap scan entirely and went to the IP to find Fuel CMS, a content management system.
Looking at the website, I could already find the answer to the next question which was the version number: 1.4.

I used searchsploit to find any exploits related to Fuel CMS version 1.4 and found this:

3 different exploits for version 1.4.1 were found. The next question asked for the CVE information so I did a quick google search and found CVE-2018-16763 on NISTs website.

I tried the 3 exploits but the one that worked the best was 50447.py. I set up a netcat listener on port 4444 using `nc -lvnp 4444` and then I created a reverse shell
using the exploit.

From here I had access to the system where I then traversed to /home/ubuntu to find the flag.

This was a really good exercise to get used to finding vulnerabilities, then learning how to exploit them! Here is a link to the vulnerability research module ->
