# Intranet THM Room

The first thing I did was use `nmap -sV <MACHINE-IP>` to figure out the open ports and services on the machine.

A few odd ports like port 7 are open but I will leave those for later. For now, I am more interested in port 80 and 8080.

Viewing the IP on port 80 on a web browser shows an under construction page as seen below, while port 8080 shows an intranet login.
